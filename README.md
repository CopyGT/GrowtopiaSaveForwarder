Detection of AV's comparasion between H4f's save forwarder and my DIY save forwader 
``My stealer: (remember that I have used virustotal and released the source of this and FUD might be gone):``

``Hack4Fun's stealer (binded with GABB, but the stealer is still contained as it is a binded executable, couldn't find any other ones but still shouldn't affect the detection too much): ``https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3ff369c72811b085d5fca439b77c3aac61a62be990b60e9cebe27d325aeddf48/detection

REMINDER: "ChattuyCS" is the client, and "Chattuy Server" the saveforwarder server. (initially used to be a chat server/client written by me)

REMINDER: This is undone code (beta).

REMINDER: If FUD expires, add a little junk code into the code, change assembly data such as guid and re compile, it may lower the detection.
